    "# Section 4: The DR5 Cluster Catalog and Visualizing Objects in the Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to use a catalog to visualize objects in the maps as well as how to stack on the locations of the objects in that catalog.  In order to look at these objects we will start by reading in a cluster catalog from [Hilton et al (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11043) that has been released as part of ACT DR5.  The catalog contains 4195 optically confirmed galaxy clusters that were obtained using the coadded maps discussed in [Section 2](Section_2_coadded_maps.ipynb).\n",

    "This code calculates the average temperature of an aperture: a circle of radius $x$ centered at the origin. It then finds the temperature of a ring of equal area around the circle (outer radius $\\sqrt{2}x$), and subtracts the temperature of this ring from the temperature of the aperture.  We repeat this for multiple radii and can then plot the AP result against radii.\n",

For example we don't account for distortions in the area of each pixel due to projection effects.

For greater radii the curve tilts away from zero as the temperature in the two increasingly differ and the ring \"ascends\" out of the source.
