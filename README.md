==================================

Authors: Nick Galitzki, Subhajit Ghosh, Vivian Sabla, Elle Shaw

Here are lectures and notebooks prepared for a CMB Analysis Summer School, hosted at the University of Texas at Austin on May 7-10, 2024. Our notebooks and files, 
contained in `UT_Notebooks`, are based on the CMB-S4 CMB Summer School notebooks written by Jeff McMahon and Rene Hlozek (found at https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool). 

Installation and Setup
----------------------
We have provided a conda environment defined in CMBSchool_environment.yml which provides an easy set up of a virtual environment with all the dependencies installed in order to run the notebooks needed for this summer school. This however requires `conda` to be installed on your local machine. Instructions for installation on different operating systems can be found at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html .
