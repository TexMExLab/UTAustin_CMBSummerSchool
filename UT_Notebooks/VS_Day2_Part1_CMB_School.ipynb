    "### Jeff McMahon Renée Hložek, updated by Vivian Sabla\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the oldest observable light in the universe. As such it carries a wealth of cosmological information including: (1) signals from the early universe (primary anisotropy), and (2) distortions imprinted as this light propagates through the universe and encounters collapsed structures (secondary anisotropy).  Measurements of these signals give us important measurements and constraints on inflationary parameters, dark energy, dark matter, the sum of the neutrino masses, and many astrophysical processes.  The development of CMB instruments and analysis techniques is rapidly evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the CMB angular power spectra of temperature fluctuations. We cover how the cosmological parameters influence the expected signal and compare spectra produced in different cosmologies to the spectra measured by CMB experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we consider only temperature fluctuations in this notebook, but all work done can be easily extrapolated to investigate polarization and cross-spectra. "

    "# Section 1.1: Angular Power Spectrum\n",
    "The majority of the information content of the CMB is contained in its angular power spectrum.   This spectrum is the amplitude squared of the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations as a function of $\\ell$.  Here $\\ell$ is the variable you have seen before with the spherical harmonics (e.g., $Y_{\\ell m}$).  $\\ell = 0$ corresponds to a constant temperature across the sky, $\\ell = 200$ corresponds approximately to scales of $1^\\circ$.  For a given set of input cosmological parameters these spectra can be computed with codes including CMBFAST or the more modern equivalent CAMB or CLASS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is fun to play with parameters and see how the spectrum changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relative locations and amplitudes of the peaks carry a great deal of information.  The location of the first peak at $\\ell \\sim 200$ provided the first definitive measurement that our universe is flat.  The shape of the spectrum constraints a wide variety of cosmological parameters including dark energy and dark matter.  The fall off at high ell (e.g. $\\ell \\gtrsim 1000$ is called the damping tail and it provides constrains on the spectral index from inflation.  A wealth of cosmological parameters are constrained by measurements of this spectrum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CLASS takes inputs in the form of a dictionary. Relevant inputs are all explained in depth in: https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/blob/master/explanatory.ini. \n",
    "Here we set our cosmology to match the best-fit model from $Planck$ 2018 $\\texttt{TTTEEE+lowE+lensing}$ (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209).  "

    "\n",
    "This section provides an introduction to analysis techniques for CMB maps as they pertain to high resolution CMB instruments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT).  These state of the art instruments have thousands of detectors (pixels) deployed on 6 and 10 meter telescopes which produce arc minute resolution beams at 150 GHz.  These telescopes observe by scanning across the sky.  The data from each detector are read out at high speed (typically > 50 Hz) to produce 'detector time streams' which are recored along with pointing information and other ancillary data.  Sophisticated codes are used to convert these time streams into maps of the CMB sky.  These maps can have correlated noise that must be accounted for in data analysis.   The mapmaking algorithms are not described here but represent a very interesting big data challenge as they require cleaning time streams by filtering, identifying transient events, and ultimately compressing ~Tb of data down to maps that are typically 100 Mb or less.  \n",

Many features are obvious in these maps including: (1) the primary CMB visible as waves in the intensity, (2) active galactic nuclei and other bright astrophysical point sources which manifest as bright dots, (3) clusters of galaxies which show up as darkened point sources, and (4) horizontal stripes (in the SPT map) that are the result of the noise and map filtering.  The ACTPol figure shows multiple maps; the T is temperature, Q and U are polarization, and E and B are also polarization but decomposed into a basis such that the E is the amplitude of the curl-free component, and B is the amplitude of the divergence free component of the polarization vector field.\n",

Here we consider a small patch of sky ($\\sim 10^\\circ \\times 10^\\circ$) were we can use the 'flat-sky' approximation and replace $\\ell$ with $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$.

If you generate it multiple times you will find that you get different patterns, however you will see that the typical size of the brightest and darkest spots will stay around $1^\\circ$, corresponding to the peak of the angular power spectrum.  All simulated sky maps are displayed with the same color scale to permit visual comparison."
